                <p class="paragraph">Zipf’s Law, Benford’s Law, and Heaps’ Law’s distributions most commonly apply to
                    literature of almost
                    every language. It is quite surprising that everyday words that we use can follow these laws.</p>
                <p class="paragraph">Zipf’s Law, a model that is used commonly for finding the distribution of terms,
                    was proposed by
                    linguist George Kingsley Zipf in 1949 for measuring the frequency of words. According to this law,
                    the word in rank r occurs 1/r times as often as the most frequent word. This law does not only work
                    for English, but for almost every language in the world. Benford’s Law, also known as the first
                    digit law, was first discovered by Dr. Frank Benford in the 1930s. It states that in listings,
                    tables of statistics, etc, 30% of the numbers start with the digit 1, and the probability of the
                    first digit 9 is always less than 5%. Heaps’ Law states that the number of unique words in a
                    collection of N words is the square root of N. This law works well when applied on books, especially
                    the Bible.
